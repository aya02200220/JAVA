It is a classic code-breaking game for two players.
But in this game, you will fight with different levels of Monsters you selected.

## Rules

While a basic rules are taking turns guessing each other's number and the first one to hit the target wins, in this game, only one player guesses a monster's number which is randomly generated.

At the start, you will be given 100 HitPoint.
Every turn after you enter a wrong number, you are attacked by the monster and receive random damage depending on the monster's level.

-`WIN ` You win when you hit the target before your HP gets 0. -`LOSE` When your HP gets 0, your game is over.

> If you were luckily keep having the lowest damage, you will have turns a lot. But if not, you don't even have 10 turns if you choose the highest level.
